# timothywu.dev | Portfolio Website

Simple portfolio site built with the intention of creating a showcase of my work, as well as learning a little more on the usage of different tools like React, Next.js, PayloadCMS and TypeScript.

I'm honestly not too happy with the UI, and plan to revisit it at some point.
